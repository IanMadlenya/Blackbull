<h2>Should we go shopping?</h2>
<p>.Once in a while, the long heated debate about where the markets are headed comes up from some corner or the other. People always discuss where the markets are headed. In our view, this is an inconsequential question to ask.</p>
<p>Markets move up because people want to buy and buy at higher prices. Secondly, markets pay for only growth. So investors should be concerned as to where they may find growth that is available at reasonable prices. In fact, investors should rejoice when the markets crack since they make stocks available for cheap. We all dance with joy when we come across a sale on goods, but still feel depressed when markets tank.</p>
<p>We at BlackBull Investments believe that the market is trading at a fair premium multiple. Such markets make it very difficult for finding good stocks available at nice valuations. However, if somebody makes us stick our neck out and take a call on the markets, we will say it is going UP.</p>
<p>We have our reasons for believing so. Last week US Fed in its FOMC meeting unveiled its Quantitative Easing policy. Fed will continue to keep the rates low in US by printing additional $600 bn. Just a day prior, RBI raised the key rates back in India to cool inflation and the unabated rise in rupee.</p>
<p>Now, the foreign money wants to earn decent returns that are just not available back in US. So the only avenues available for them are emerging markets. Out of these emerging markets, India despite being a bit expensive compared to some other emerging markets, is still very attractive given stable political environment and some of the best corporate names.</p>
<p>So, US money will keep flowing in pushing up the prices. This will also create an upward pressure on rupee thus hurting the Indian exporters. That is why Indian investors should take heart and invest in companies that have a domestic oriented business model.</p>
<p class="last">What investors must track closely are the actions of these banks. They will give us the cue as to when the markets should head south. Till then keep asking the price and keep shopping.</p>
