<h2>Heil RBI</h2>
<p>The monetary policy unveiled by RBI yesterday reveals the prudent and conservative policy management of the central bank. The key takeaways from the policy were:</p>
<p>Repo rate increased to 6.25% and reverse repo rate increased to 5.25%. This move is designed to tame inflation that sits above the comfort levels. The logic is that RBI by raising rates makes it attractive for banks to park cash with RBI thus reducing the amount available for credit. This is a classical way of controlling liquidity.</p>
<p>RBI said that it will manage liquidity prudently. This is slightly contrarily to the above point but must be seen in the light of the financial system. There has been a huge demand for cash in the wake of the Coal India IPO and increased inflow of foreign money. The foreign inflows raise the demand for rupee thus straightening it. Thus the rampant demand for rupee can potentially create a liquidity crisis. RBI wants to avert the same.</p>
<p>The loan to value ratio for house loans capped at 80%. This means that if you want to buy a house worth INR 100, you can at max borrow INR 80 from the banks. This thus prevents the real estate bubble to form in India but is bad for real estate companies.</p>
<p>All financial conglomerates like banks will have to make extra provisions for their subsidiary and affiliate investments. This is a great move and will present the true picture of the banks. This may take some sheen off the robust balance sheets of banks but is a very good move to increase transparency.</p>
<p class="last">In summary, RBI has once again kept its head above its shoulders and delivered. The investors and the markets have not reacted since the interest rate hike was already factored in the prices. Going forward, the housing prices will come down by 15% to 25%.</p>
