<h2>Happy New Year!</h2>
<p>BlackBull Investment Company wishes all its clients a very happy and prosperous new year 2011. May you be blessed with the choicest blessings and prosper in health and wealth.</p>
<p>We firmly believe that speculation is root of all bad decisions but still a little though about the coming year is in order. There are many analysts trying to predict the future and we have possible scenarios of both gloom and doom. You can pick up any newspaper or finance magazine to read about these unnamed and unsure analysts.</p>
<p>But what should you do as a retail investor? Should you start buying or book profits or just run to the safe haven of fixed deposits and bonds? The answer lies in a simple thought framework: Think like a Businessman.</p>
<p>A businessman is never worried about the price that other people are putting on its business. He is more concerned to reign in the costs, improve market share and financing the business. As shareholders, it will be a good New Year resolution to understand the business models of all the companies that we hold in our portfolios. The following are the few steps that you may follow to understand your businesses:</p>
<ul style="list-style-position:inside;">
<li>Download the annual report of the last three years of the company.</li>
<li>Make yourself some good coffee or tea and settle down to do some heavy reading.</li>
<li>Start with the Director&#8217;s Speech. Read the three years&#8217; speeches to see how the company has been doing. Take notes &#8211; ALWAYS.</li>
<li>Then begin reading the MD&A section of the annual report. If you do not understand the business model after reading this, you either need to learn the business from someone who knows or SELL THE STOCK. You are not a good businessman to have stay invested in a business you have no idea about.</li>
<li>This exercise will allow you to rank the businesses by the most important metric: Your understanding of the business. It will now be the time to look at the financial statements.</li>
<li>We will soon be posting a tutorial on how to read the different financial statements. But just to keep it interesting, it will only be available to people who successfully finish the above three steps.</li>
</ul>
<p>HAPPY NEW YEAR.</p>
