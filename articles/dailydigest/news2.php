<h2>The Good Times May just be around</h2>
<p>I would like the readers to recall from our article "Small is Beautiful" that one of the themes that will strogly play out in India is the Telecom story. Given the low penetration of mobile connectivity, there is a lot of work left for the companies to do.</p>
<p>However, the past 6 quarters have been very abysmal for the telecom service providers. Rampant competition, ruthless tariff wars and insanely unprofitable call plans - all led to lower margins. The result - most telecom companies have underperformed the broad indices.</p>
<p>But last week, the first ray of hope cam through when the government hinted that the exit barriers for telecom companies will be lowered. This means that the numerous companies who had mopped up licenses but are not able to grow will be allowed to exit. This move will usher in the much awaited consolidation in the industry. The Indian telecom market does not have room beyond six national carriers. Companies like BPL, Uninor and may more have failed to scale up and have ended up hurting the sector profitability.</p>
<p class="last">So, the incumbents like Bharti Airtel, Vodafone and Idea will be able to buy some of these companies out and will see a rising interest in their profitability. In other words, it is a good time to take a hard look at those long forgotten telecom stocks.</p>
