<h2>The Irony about Analysts Coverage</h2>
<p>The equity analysts usually leave entire sectors untouched. They may go around writing about the well known bell weather stocks while completely ignoring entire sectors that show promising growth opportunities. Investors should always be on the lookout for such sectors.</p>
<p>The logic behind this investment strategy is that the market only pays for growth. The wealth is created in stocks when the PE or P/BV multiples of a stock rise. It is not very difficult to imagine that the overlooked sectors usually spend a lot of time sitting there quietly, churning great growth and waiting to be discovered by the market. Therefore, when an investor buys into such sectors early, he has the greatest odds of making a killing.</p>
<p>Peter Lynch, the iconic Fidelity fund manager, used to love companies that the analysts do not track. His logic was precisely the PE expansion.</p>
<p>The obvious question that comes to the mind is how can I go about finding such sectors. There are many ways people spot such opportunities. One simple way is to fetch the PE of all the stocks that trade at a PE multiple less than its sector average. You can use Yahoo Finanace India website to perform this. The other intuitive approach is to look at the consumer facing goods like automobiles, medicines or electronics and think about the kind of companies that act as suppliers to these industries. Chances are that you will land up with a supplier industry that is completely unsexy, untracked and very profitable.</p>
<p>As a case in point, all of us have seen the dobling and tripling of the auto stocks. How many of us have wondered about the suppliers to these industries - comapnies that make tyres, batteries, switchgears and many more. A simple investigation will lead you to the highly undervalued tyre and battery stocks. This is how we initiated coverage on Apollo Tyres and have started to look at battery stocks.</p>
<p class="last">So the next time, you see an untracked stock, take a good hard look.</p>
