<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>e at BlackBull Investments strongly believe that every stock is a personality. These are not lifeless entitlements to a company's ownership. These are real people with their own idiosyncrasies and behavioural patterns. Therefore, when you go out to pick a stock, imagine yourself going out to an adoption agency to adopt a child. I hope we need not elaborate on this that each child is different.</p><p>Stocks too fall in various categories. Some are like 100m sprinters who grow at a scorching pace for many years on a clip before retiring. The others are marathon runners - slow but steady. However, years of experience have taught us one thing. The categories of stocks that make you lose most money are 'The Cyclical'.</p><p>A cycle is our life refers to a process that repeats itself over a period of time. The most common cycles that any person is aware of are: the earth's rotation, the earth's revolution, tides in sea, periods of economic boom and bust and even our neighbourhood merry-go-round! The Cyclical stocks too lend themselves to cyclical or periodic tendencies.</p><p>In simplistic terms, a cyclical stock belongs to a company whose revenue and profits rise and fall in periodical time frames. These companies will make huge profits for many years and then go slow for the next few years - repeating this cycle of rise and fall in a pretty predictable fashion. These companies would not be the organisations whose sales keep expanding. Rather these companies' bottom and top lines could be imagined like the tummy of a sleeping baby - expanding and contracting in a rhythm.</p>

<h3>Where Do I find these stocks</h3>
</header>
<p>Cyclical stocks are found in industries whose fortunes are tied closely with two factors:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Growth rate of the economy</li>
<li>The affluence of the consumer class</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, cyclical stocks are found in industries that thrive on a growing economy where people are optimistic and willing to buy goods rather than save. The following list, though not exhaustive, gives you a starting point with certain sectors that are cyclical in nature:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Metals: </b>Companies that operate in business of metals like steel, aluminium, copper and so on are cyclical. These companies will be able to sell their products only when the economy is growing. People and their governments tend to spend more on infrastructure during periods of economic growth and hence the demand for metals soars.</li>
<li><b>Cement: </b>Companies in this sector are also closely tied with the growth rate of the economy. The construction activity is more fervent in good times than bad. These companies have another cyclical factor associated with them - the monsoons. These companies will witness slow dispatches and sales during rainy season given the hampering of construction.</li>
<li><b>Autos and Auto Ancillaries: </b>These belong to second category where the fortunes of a company are tied with the affluence of the consumer. People do not keep buying cars year after year. In India, most buyers save for the vehicle and then avail part credit to purchase the car. Now, these people will be more inclined to get the car in an economic boom period where they would have witnessed a rise in their disposable incomes coupled with easy credit from banks and consumer finance companies. However, a completely reverse will happen in a recession.</li>
</ul>

<h3>How to invest in a cyclical stock</h3>
</header>
<p>It is really hard to put it this way but the only way you can make money in cyclical stocks is by TIMING. You need to get in these stocks just before their upmove is about to start and get out just before the euphoria ends.</p><p>This may sound contrary to the accepted rule about investing - DO NOT TIME THE MARKETS. But cyclical are an exception. You have to time your entry and exit if you intend to dabble in these scrips. Timing is everything in cyclical. You will have to detect the early signs that the business is falling off or picking up.</p><p>BlackBull Investments have compiled the following list of golden guidelines that you will do well to observe before you commit your capital to a cyclical stocks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cyclicals form the best bet when the economy is just coming out of a recession. Keep a tab on the economy and its indicators. Once you are sure that the economy is all set to start a fresh growth wave, it is time to include some cyclical into your portfolio.</li>
<li>Invest in cyclical when their PE is high. We understand that this again contradicts the basic rule of investing about avoiding investments in high PE stocks. But with cyclical, especially the ones in the commodity based business like steel and metals, you must get in when their PE is high. For example, Tata Steel had a PE of 48 in the beginning of 2001. This is just when the economy started another secular bull run after the dotcom bust. The stock became a ten bagger and its PE reduced to 5.7.</li>
<li>It pays well to have a look at the charts of the commodities that your stock trades in on the London Metal Exchange.  Remember that a crash in the commodity prices almost invariable precedes a crash on the domestic bourses.</li>
<li>If you work in a profession that is connected to steel or metals or any other cyclical, you will be able to notice the change in the business cycle beforehand. You can make quite prudent calls just by noticing the changes that happened in your business.</li>
<li>Never invest in a cyclical just because government imposes some import duty on the commodity. For example, the government may impose a 10% duty on steel that is imported. This is done to protect the domestic industry. This may produce a short term spike but certainly never fetch a substantial gain since the investors are nt sure about how long the duty will stay.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Word of Caution</h3>
</header>
<p>Cyclical stocks are one of the most misunderstood categories of stocks. The reason for this is that most of these companies are well entrenched and respected names. Therefore, retail investors often invest in these companies without being aware of their inherent business cycle. For example, one may assume that Tata Motors is a bluechip and hence will yield stable returns just like a SunPharma. They may invest on the top of the steel cycle and then watch losing their money in the ensuing years. This investor will cry foul and never return to the markets again.</p><p>This is the reason we do not subscribe to the philosophy of sticking to a stock category. Investors must always picture the child adoption paradigm before they buy into a stock.</p>

<h3>Our view</h3>
</header>
<p>We believe that the Indian economy is still not completely out of the woods. The valuations of most companies look stretched. The monsoon too has played a spoilsport and this again does not portend well for the economy. India also has a huge fiscal deficit which may be injected back into the economy as inflation.</p><p>The country is enjoying a period of low inflation as of now. However, one the inflation starts inching up, which it will; RBI will have no option but to harden the interest rates. This will translate into less lending by the banks and lead to a down cycle.</p><p>We in no way guarantee or predict the outcome but only anticipate the future course of the economy. Given our bearish stance, we will recommend all investors to stay away from the cyclical stocks as of now.</p>
