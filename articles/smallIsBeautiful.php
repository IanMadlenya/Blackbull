<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>he current market turmoil has made a lot of investors rethink their Investment Styles. It is unfathomable for these investors to understand how the time tested and proven blue chip and large cap investing theory so terribly fail. The so called stars of mutual funds that by style and law, invested only in nifty are at a loss of words to justify their bottomed out NAV.</p>
<p>We certainly do not advocate against the prudence of large cap investing but urge the investors to look at this entire financial collapse in a different light.</p>

<h3>The Intended Audience</h3>
</header>
<p>We feel it is our duty to discuss the personality and investment style practitioners that will benefit from the approach we intend to recommend in this article. Since ages, the investors have been scalped into two schools of thought: Value Investors and Growth Investors.</p>
<p><b>Value Investors:</b> A value investor is on the search for discount sales.  This investor would look at companies past. He will focus on the past many years of data to determine if the company indeed has been an outperformer. His principle argument is simple. If the company has been consistent in performance through good and bad patches in the past, it would continue to grow with approximately the same rate in the future. The value investor is a patient man. Once he is convinced of the company's potential, he would keep waiting for the markets to do something stupid and offer him the stock at a discount.</p>
<p><b>Growth Investors:</b> A growth investor believes in the future promise of a company. This person believes in what the company intends to do next and hence he has no qualms about paying a premium to acquire the stock. These investors risk appetite is more and are willing to back the lesser known companies provided these companies show a significant promise.</p>
<p>Our article would certainly strike a chord with the Growth School of Investors. However, we certainly invite all investors to go through.</p>

<h3>Why Small is Beautiful</h3>
</header>
<p>A Small Cap is a company that is classified under the T and Z group of the NSE and BSE stocks. These companies have low market capitalization. Period.</p>
<p><i>It does not mean that the company is poor in its business.</i></p>
<p>Most people are of the opinion that investing in small cap stocks is fraught with risk and is a game to be only played by market operators and insiders.  This viewpoint is not all wrong. If one looks at the history of Indian stock markets he will find a number of instances where innocent retail investors were taken for a ride by the operators. But one should not forget that those were also the days when SEBI was a non-existent institution and the Indian markets were pretty unregulated.</p>
<p>Things seem to have come full circle since then. The present Indian markets are one of the most regulated and SEBI has sure won confidence as the watchdog.</p>
<p>Given these developments, it is a pretty level playing field for the retail investor to dabble in the small cap scene. I may state that the large and reputed companies of today like Infosys, Bharti and Praj were once small caps. Imagine how fortunate the smart investors who found these companies in their early stages would have benefited!</p>
<p>I want you to focus on the word smart investors. Yes. These were not the run of the mill rumor fed stock junkies. These people were the smartest of the pack that did two simple things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Research the company before buying.</li>
<li>Research the company after buying.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our emphasis on research is not limited to reading the financial statements. It encompasses mathematics and asks the investor to look at the business. A stock is nothing but a part ownership in a business. It is a way of expressing your confidence in the business. The smart investor digs into the business of the company. For this, he needs to talk to the company's stakeholders like customers, vendors, competitors and the management.</p>
<p>And while he is doing this research, he also needs to have an edge. He must do his research before the world comes to know else the gains would get reflected in the stock price almost immediately.</p>
<p>Over the years that we have managed private money, we have found certain unique characteristics about small caps which lend themselves magnificently to an investor's research efforts.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h4>Talk to Owners, not MBA grads</h4>
<p>At small companies, you get to speak with the owners. These companies are run by few eminent people unlike big giants where a whole army of business graduates are running the show. These small company owners are entrepreneurial. Hence, they are less pretentious about telling the real story. In big companies, you must be real shrewd or lucky to get past the cold investor relations man.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Simple to Understand</h4>
<p>Invest in what you know. Small companies are usually engaged in one sole line of business. They seldom waver from their niche operation. Hence, it is easier for an investor to comprehend their business model, sales pitch and other business aspects. On the other hand, big companies are like seaweeds; spread across domains and multiple lines of businesses. The investor may have a hard time figuring out their real story.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Big Pay-Offs</h4>
<p>Small caps are the land of jackpots and lotteries. It is nearly impossible to find a large or even a mid cap that may see a ten times increase in its stock price. Don't take our word for this. An Internet search would reveal lot of academic studies conducted across various markets that highlight this truth. For example, a study conducted by Rolf Banz, a professor at university of Chicago, postulates that small caps have provided a risk adjusted returns of 12.5 percent compared to returns of 10.5 percent provided by the large caps.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Huge opportunity size</h4>
<p>When Infosys came out with its IPO, not even the owners would have dreamt the true size of the business they were targeting. The Indian IT scene had just started to warm up and the small cap was sitting right there in the middle of this action - with a smirk on its face. Small companies that operate in a market whose opportunity size is disproportionately high compared to the market cap of the company form one of the best investments.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>How to find the One</h3>
</header>
<p>Most inventors find themselves clueless when asked to research the companies on their own. They are not clueless because they don't have the expertise of reading balance sheets. They are clueless because they have no process or system to guide them in their search.</p>
<p>Bombay Stock exchange hosts xxx number of stocks. How then can you research such a mammoth universal set without some kind of a compass? </p>
<p class="note">Note: The process outlined here is not the only way an investor can pick stocks. We also refrain from claiming this to be the best. However, this may serve as an introduction to investors who seek a systematic way of searching stocks.</p>

<h3>Trend Spotting</h3>
</header>
<p>Spare a minute and ponder as to what drives the profitability of a company. The answer that should come to your mind is - the customers. A company will be in business only so long as the customers are willing to pay the price that it charges. This is an undeniable truth of business. It doesn't matter if you apply this to an FMCG company or a banking firm. Demand drives profits. Hence, an investor must start from the top.</p>
<p>An investor should look around and identify the significant social, economic and technological trends. This task requires no degree in business but a common sense and awareness. However, an investor will do well if he identifies trends that may last for a minimum of 4 to 5 years since this would allow him to ignore cyclical trends, eg; spike in selling of fire crackers around Diwali.</p>
<p>An investor will have to develop a mindset to look for trends in his daily interactions, readings and experiences. As an example, any investor who would have seen the way computers were invading our lives would have cared to investigate the trend. There was a time when almost every investor would have come face to face with a computer and seen how the wonderful machine was changing the way things get done. This investor should have latched on to the technology trend and may have invested in Infosys which was a small cap and a leader in this niche.</p>
<p>However, a little caution here is not unwarranted. At times, an investor will see that an obvious trend does not pan out as anticipated. As an example, a lot of people brought the world down with cries of oil price tearing through the roof. In the early 2008, oil started trading near $140. A lot of investors would have thought this rise in oil price as a trend and bought exploration and upstream oil stocks only to see the price drop to $40 in three months. An investor will have to accept such follies and keep walking.</p>
<p>We may here like to point you to some of the megabucks trend that has the potential of playing out in India in the coming years:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h4>Building Infrastructure</h4>
<p>The emerging market of India is seeing a rapid pace in business activity. India today is not a country of snake charmers but a global investment destination. It is imperative that if India has to capitalize on the opportunity of globalization, it has to build infrastructure on a massive scale. Ports, power plants, highways, river ways, airports and communication systems are just to name a few components of this trend. An investor may look at stocks of engineering companies, construction majors, cement companies, steel companies and power companies to play this trend.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Telecom</h4>
<p>The average phone density in developed worlds is around 70 telephones between 100 citizens. In developing nations this figure is a dismal 0.1 in 100 citizens. This gap will be closing in the coming years. The telecom companies have the political will to bridge the divide and make communication lines reach every nook and corner of the country. An investor may look at telecom and communication companies to play this trend.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Energy Security</h4>
<p>India is an energy deficient country. We are short of energy numbers. The Indo-US nuclear deal carried India's energy security as a major negotiation theme. Our neighbor China has been aggressively gobbling up energy sources around the world to keep its growth engine chugging. India too is playing this trend aggressively and cannot afford to downplay this theme. An investor may look at energy exploration companies to play this theme.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Banking and Financial Services</h4>
<p>In Indian only 4 percent of the citizens hold a bank account. The numbers for the financial services are more dismal. The government with its resolution to cut down black money in the Indian economy, boost access to banking services and integrate the rural India with the mainstream augur well for banks and financial institutions that have a rural presence. An investor may look at banking and financial institution stocks to play this theme.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Education</h4>
<p>India is hailed as one of the most promising emerging markets. Talks of India becoming a global superpower have been doing the rounds since past half a decade. The key strength of India lies in its population. India can grow only by empowering this 1 billion population and the way forward is education. An investor can play the vocational institution, education technology stocks to play this trend.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Food</h4>
<p>Need we say more? India is a country that has a growing population and hence would constantly search for ways and means that may improve the farm productivity. To feed this large population, India needs to invest in agriculture innovation, grain transportation and financial support system. An investor may look at fertilizer and irrigation stocks to play this trend.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These are a sample of themes that hold a lot of promise. An investor however should not restrict himself to these alone and must look out for himself.</p>
<p>As Sherlock Holmes famously remarked, <i>"Don't just look, observe".</i></p>
<p>An investor should realize at the very forefront that it takes a lot of hard work to separate wheat from the chaff. Identifying the trends is only half the job accomplished. The rest half lays in following the three step process outlined below:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h4>Does the company promise growth?</h4>
<p>The market at the end pays a premium only for growth. The value investing school practitioners may disagree and claim that they look out for discounts. But what good is a discount bargain if the rest of the mass never realize the value of it. The market bids up stocks only when they promise growth.</p>
<p>Therefore, your candidates should also reflect the promise of growth. An investor should ascertain if the company he intends to invest in has a niche and an able management to exploit that niche. This is a powerful insight. As mentioned earlier, demand drives profits. A company whose products are constantly in demand would always be more profitable that its peers. This means that an investor will do well to steer clear of companies that compete in a commodity business.</p>
<p>An ideal growth company will be able to raise prices of its products without a slack in the demand. This can happen only when the company has a niche - be it technological, marketing strength or patents.</p>
<p>Once an investor is convinced that his target company has a niche, he must move on to ascertain the quality of the management. This is a tough job as most retail investors may not have access to top management. Here again sticking to small caps is beneficial. An investor is more likely to reach the manager in a small cap than an executive in a large conglomerate.</p>
<p>An investor needs to look at the qualifications of the management, their expertise in the business and their outlook towards the broader industry and economy. The company's annual and quarterly reports are a great source of this information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Does the company has financial strength?</h4>
<p>Note that we advocate financial strength and not mere stability. A small cap needs to be financially strong because it needs to rapidly grow. Stability is a question that is more pertinent for larger enterprises.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, market pays for growth. But this principle also has a corollary. The market severely punishes de growth. As an example, a company that has shown growth of 50% or so year on year may be the darling of the markets. But the moment, the company has a year with a growth of 40%; the market would ground the stock. Small caps are enriching because they can grow with spectacular rates on a clip. And the slowdown is a sign for further investigation.</p>
<p>Growth requires resources. A company needs capital to finance its growth. There are a number of ways a company can finance its capital structure. A company can dilute its equity through a IPO or a company can raise debt. An investor should be very careful while evaluating the capital structure of a company. Too much debt can ruin small companies. The problem with debt is that if a company slackens in earnings it would feel the pinch of paying interest to its debenture holders. This is a recipe for disaster for small caps. However, an investor should have an understanding of the sector. This is needed because the level of debt that an industry may warrant as safe differs on a case by case basis. For example, a consumer loan company may carry a debt that may not be health for a manufacturing firm.</p>
<p>An investor should also pay close attention to popular ratios like P/E and P/Cash Flow. These ratios should give him a fair bit of understanding about the performance of a company with respect to its peers.</p>
<p>We could go on to talk about financial statements and their implications but that would grow out of scope of this article.</p>
<p><i>The bottom-line is that your small cap should have comfortable debt situation coupled with a rising operating profit.</i></p>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Is the current market price fair?</h4>
<p>The last spoke is to judge if the market is offering the small cap at a fair price. Usually this fair price is determined using financial models like Discounted Cash Flow, Dividend Discount Model and so on. These models are used by the analysts to set fair prices for various stocks. Hence, an investor who dabbles in large caps would find enough research reports covering his stock. He can thus gain a view on the fair price of the security by polling in the estimates set by various research analysts.</p>
<p>However, for a small cap investor it is more often the case that no one is covering the company he is interested in. In such a case, the investor will have to perform his own modeling. There are a lot of free excel sheets available on the Internet that automate the modeling. One can download the same and use.</p>
<p>As another option, an investor would do well to take help from trusted investment advisors like BlackBull Investment Company to help with his target stock.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
</header>
<p>The small caps are a land of big playoffs and spectacular failures. As a parting remark, we strongly encourage the investors to look at this uncharted universe of small caps. Remember that in each bull run, some strong small caps always graduate to become mid or large caps. These companies are the true wealth creators. This is an opportune moment to begin your search for the next big thing. Who knows your millions may be stashed in your back yard.</p>
