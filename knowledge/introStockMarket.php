<h3>Trading in ancient India</h3>
</header>
<p>Trading has been a part and parcel of our society since ancient times. In those days, trade was mostly practiced under <i>barter system</i> i.e. goods were exchanged for goods. But difficulty in handling goods and fixing the exchange value of the goods led to the use of some common items like shells, conches, food items etc. as medium of exchange. During medieval period metallic coins made of bronze, copper, silver and gold became popular for trading . In 1835 the East India Company introduced the rupee as a medium of exchange . That is in brief the primitive Indian trading for you.</p>
<p>Let us now start understanding why investment is required in modern times. Every person has a stream of income which he uses to furnish the needs of his life. The balance that is left after spending on his life's needs is called Savings. This person now has two choices. He can either put the money safely in a locker as cold cash or he can put the money in instruments that will increase the value of his money. The latter form of money parking is termed as Investments.</p>
<p>One needs to invest to achieve the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Earn returns on the saving which are idle.</li>
<li>Secure the uncertain future.</li>
<li>Achieve monetary support for the financial goals of life.</li>
</ol>
<p>In financial terms, one should invest wisely to meet the cost of inflation. Inflation is the rate at which the cost of living increases. The cost of living is simply what it costs to buy goods and services  you need to live. Inflation causes money to lose its value because of which it will not buy the same amount of goods or services in the future as it did in the past.</p>
<p>So now the question that comes to your  mind is, when should one start investing,?The answer to this is the sooner, the better and the success mantra is invest early, regularly and for long term and not for short term.</p>
<p>Now let us discuss what are the options available for investment:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Physical assets</b> like real estate, gold/jewellery etc. 
<li><b>Financial assets</b> such as fixed deposits with banks, small saving instruments with post offices, insurance/provident/pension fund etc. or the securities market related instruments in the form of shares, bonds, debentures etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now we shall focus more on Securities market:</p>
<p>Savings are linked to investments by a variety of intermediaries, through a range of financial products, called 'Securities'.</p>
<p>There are some terms which one needs to be familiar with before understanding Securities market. The moment we think about Securities market, Stock Exchange comes to our mind. The Securities Contract (Regulation) Act, 1956 [SCRA] defines 'Stock Exchange' as anybody  of individuals, whether incorporated or not, constituted for the purpose of assisting, regulating or controlling the business of buying, selling or dealing in securities.</p>
<p>Stock Exchange to many of us means Share MarketSo what does this Share mean?,It can be put as total equity capital of a company is divided into equal units of small denominations, each called share.For example, in a company the total equity capital of Rs 2, 00,000 is divided into 20,000 units of Rs 10 each. Each such unit of Rs 10 is called a Share. Thus, the company then is said to have 20,000 equity shares of Rs 10 each. The holders of such shares are members of the company and have voting rights.</p>
<p>The other common term in the world of Share market is Index or the Sensex.The index or the Sensex as we know, displays how the specified portfolio of share prices are moving in order to give an indication of market trends. It is a basket of securities  and the average price movement of the basket of securities indicates the index movement, whether upwards or downwards.Now we are in a position to discuss Securities Markets.The Securities Market is a place where buyers and sellers of securities can enter into transactions to purchase and sell shares, bonds, debentures etc. Further, it performs an important role of enabling corporate houses, entrepreneurs to raise resources for their companies and business ventures through public issues. Transfer of resources from those having idle resources (investors) to others who have a need for them (corporate houses) is most efficiently achieved through the securities market. Stated formally, securities markets provide channels for reallocation of savings to investments and entrepreneurship The main participants in the securities market essentially has three categories - namely, the issuers of securities, investors in securities and last but in no way less important the intermediaries, such as merchant bankers, brokers etc. While the corporate houses and government raise resources from the securities market to meet their obligations, it is households that invest their savings in the securities market.</p>
<p>The securities market has two interdependent segments: the primary market and the secondary market. The primary market provides the channel for sale of new securities while the secondary market deals in securities previously issued.</p>

<h3>Primary Market</h3>
</header>
<p>The <i>primary market</i> provides the channel for sale of new securities. It provides opportunity to issuers of securities; Government as well as corporate houses,  raise resources to meet their requirements of investment and/or discharge some obligation. They may issue the securities at face value, or at a discount/premium and these securities may take a variety of forms such as equity, debt etc.  They may issue the securities in domestic market and/or international market.</p>
<p>The promoters' capital and the borrowings from banks and financial institutions may not be sufficient for setting up or running the business over a long term which have been started by them as a private firm. So companies invite the public to contribute towards the equity and issue shares to individual investors. The way to invite share capital from the public is through a 'Public Issue'. Simply stated, a public issue is an offer to the public to subscribe to the share capital of a company. Once this is done, the company allots shares to the applicants as per the prescribed rules and regulations laid down by Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI).</p>
<p>An Initial Public Offer (IPO)  is the selling of securities to the public in the primary market. It is when an unlisted company makes either a fresh issue of securities or an offer for sale of its existing securities or both for the first time to the public. This paves way for listing and trading of the issuer's securities. The sale of securities can be either through book building or through normal public issue.</p>

<h3>Secondary Market</h3>
</header>
<p>Secondary market refers to a market where securities are traded after being initially offered to the public in the primary market and/or listed on the Stock Exchange. Majority of the trading is done in the secondary market. Secondary market comprises of equity markets and the debt markets.</p>
<p>For the general investor, the secondary market provides an efficient platform for trading of his securities. For the management of the company, Secondary equity markets serve as a monitoring and control conduit.  It facilitates in bringing in  value-enhancing control activities, enabling implementation of incentive-based management contracts, and aggregating information (via price discovery) thereby helping to  guide management decisions.</p>
<p>In the primary market, securities are offered to public for subscription for the purpose of raising capital or fund. Secondary market is an equity trading venue in which already existing/pre-issued securities are traded among investors.</p>
<p>The stock exchanges in India, under the overall supervision of the regulatory authority, the SEBI, provide a trading platform, where buyers and sellers can meet to transact in securities. The trading platform provided by Exchange is an electronic one and there is no need for buyers and sellers to meet at a physical location to trade. They can trade through the computerized trading screens available with the trading members or the internet based trading facility provided by the trading members.</p>
<p>An investor does not get any protection if he trades outside a stock exchange. Trading at the exchange offers investors the best prices prevailing at the time in the market, lack of any counter-party risk which is assumed by the clearing corporation, access to investor grievance and redressal mechanism of stock exchanges, protection upto a prescribed limit  from the Investor Protection Fund etc.</p>

<h3>Equity Investments</h3>
</header>
<p>When you buy a share of a company you become a shareholder in that company. Shares are also known as Equities. Equities have the potential to increase in value over time. It also provides your portfolio with the growth necessary to reach your long term investment goals. Research studies have proved that the equities have outperformed most other forms of investments in the long term. This may be illustrated with the help of following examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Over a 15 year period between 1990 to 2005, Nifty has given an annualised return of 17%.</li>
<li>For e.g. Mr. XYZ invests in Nifty on January 1, 2000 (index value 1592.90). The Nifty value as of end December 2005 was 2836.55. Holding this investment over this period Jan 2000 to Dec 2005 he gets a return of 78.07%. Investment in shares of ONGC Ltd for the same period gave a return of 465.86%, SBI 301.17% and Reliance 281.42%.</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore,</p>
<ul>
<li>Equities are considered the most challenging and the rewarding, when compared to other investment options.</li>
<li>Research studies have proved that investments in some shares with a longer tenure of investment have yielded far superior returns than any other investment.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, this does not mean all equity investments would guarantee similar high returns. Equities are high risk investments. It is like a hot pan. You should know how to cook without  burning your fingers. One needs to study them carefully before investing.</p>
<p>Since 1990 till date, Indian stock market has returned about 17% to investors on an average in terms of increase in share prices or capital appreciation annually. Besides that,on an average stocks have paid 1.5% dividend annually. Dividend is a percentage of the face value of a share that a company returns to its shareholders from its annual profits. Compared to most other forms of investments, investing in equity shares offers the highest rate of return, if invested over a longer duration.</p>

<p>Broadly there are two factors which influence the price of the stock: (1) stock specific and (2) market specific. The stock-specific factor is related to  expectations of the masses about the company, its future earnings capacity, financial health and managementalong with its level of technology and marketing skills.</p>

<p>The market specific factor is influenced by the investors sentiment towards the stock market as a whole. This factor depends on the environment rather than the performance of any particular company. Events favourable to an economy, political or regulatory environment like high economic growth, friendly budget, stable government etc. can fuel euphoria in the investors, resulting in a boom in the market. On the other hand, unfavourable events like war, economic crisis, communal riots, minority government etc. depress the market irrespective of certain companies performing well. However, the effect of market-specific factor is generally short-term. Despite ups and downs, price of a stock in the long run gets stabilized based on the stockspecific factors. Therefore, a prudent advice to all investors is to analyse and invest and not speculate in shares.</p>
<p>One can acquire shares in the following ways:</p>
<p>One  may subscribe to issues made by corporates in the primary market. In the primary market, resources are mobilised by the corporates through fresh public issues (IPOs) or through private placements. Alternately, you may purchase shares from the secondary market. To buy and sell securities you should approach a SEBI registered trading member (broker) of a recognized stock exchange.</p>
<p>In the investment world we come across the term as Portfolio, it is nothing but the combination of different investment assets mixed and matched for the purpose of achieving an investor's goal(s). Items that are considered a part of your portfolio can include any asset you own-from shares, debentures, bonds, mutual fund units to items such as gold, art and even real estate etc. However, for most investors a portfolio has come to signify an investment in financial instruments like shares, debentures, fixed deposits, mutual fund units.</p>
<p>A good investment portfolio is a mix of a wide range of asset class. Different securities perform differently at  a point of time.So with a mix of asset types, your entire portfolio does not suffer the impact of a decline of any one security. When your stocks go down, you may still have the stability of the bonds in your portfolio. There have been all sorts of academic studies and formulas that demonstrate why diversification is important, but it's really just the simple practice of "not putting all your eggs in one basket." If you spread your investments across various types of assets and markets, you'll reduce the risk of your entire portfolio getting affected by the adverse returns of any single asset class.</p>
<p>So that concludes our first take on the journey of a novice into the world of trading and equities. Trading is not gamble. It is a well calculated mathematics of statistics and companies performance.</p> 
<p class="last">Keep an eye here, and we might help you in taking steps onto the success ladder in this world of trading with our future articles.</p>
